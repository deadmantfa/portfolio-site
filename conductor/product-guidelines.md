# Product Guidelines - Wenceslaus Dsilva Portfolio

## Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic:** Modern Minimalist High-Tech.
- **Color Palette:** "Dark Mode" foundation with a palette of deep slates and blacks. sophistication is added through high-contrast neon accents (e.g., Electric Blue or Cyber Lime) used exclusively for Three.js elements and primary CTAs.
- **Typography:** A combination of a clean, geometric Sans-Serif for headers (e.g., Inter or Montserrat) and a highly readable Serif or Sans-Serif for body text. Monospace accents for technical details.

## Messaging & Tone
- **Voice:** Authority with Personality.
- **Tone:** Professional, confident, and seasoned. The writing should be accessible and human, translating complex architectural decisions into clear strategic value without relying on excessive jargon.

## Interaction Design
- **Animation Strategy:** Purposeful Immersion.
- **Behavior:** The Three.js 3D timeline is the centerpiece, designed with smooth, physics-based transitions. Hover effects should be subtle but reactive, providing a sense of depth and tactile feedback.
- **Performance:** Ensure all Three.js elements are optimized for fast loading and smooth framerates (60fps) to maintain the "premium" feel.

## Content Strategy
- **Storytelling:** Focus on the evolution of leadership. Every role described should highlight not just the tech used, but the impact made and the strategic vision applied.
- **SEO Integration:** Naturally incorporate keywords like "CTO," "Technical Leadership," and "Software Architecture" into headers and body prose without sacrificing readability.
