# Specification: Refined Contact Experience

## Overview
This final track replaces the simple `mailto` link with an "Architectural Handshake"—a high-end, immersive conclusion to the portfolio journey. It features a professional contact form integrated with a final 3D "Connection" scene, ensuring the last touchpoint is as technically impressive as the 3D epochs.

## Functional Requirements
- **Contact Form Component**: A polished HTML form with fields for Name, Email, and Message.
- **3D Connection Scene**: A final Three.js visualization that activates in the contact section (e.g., a "Closing Node" or "Data Core").
- **Social Integration**: High-fidelity icons for LinkedIn and GitHub using Lucide React.
- **Success State**: An immersive transition or 3D state change upon successful form submission simulation.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Aesthetic**: Match the "Architectural Authority" system (glass materials, primary OKLCH glow).
- **Accessibility**: Ensure form fields have proper labels and focus rings.
- **Validation**: Client-side validation for email and required fields.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Contact section features a functional, accessible form instead of just a link.
- [ ] A dedicated 3D scene provides a unique backdrop for the contact area.
- [ ] Social links are integrated into the final layout.
- [ ] Submission triggers a clear "Success" visual state.

## Out of Scope
- Backend server implementation (submission will be simulated/client-side for this prototype).
