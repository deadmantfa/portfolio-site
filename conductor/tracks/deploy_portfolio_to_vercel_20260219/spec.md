## Overview
This track covers the tasks required to create a GitHub repository, push the existing code to it, and deploy the portfolio website to Vercel, connecting it to the `w1d.pro` domain.

## Functional Requirements
- A new public GitHub repository named `portfolio-site` will be created under the `deadmantfa` account.
- The current project code will be pushed to the new GitHub repository.
- The project will be deployed on Vercel.
- The custom domain `w1d.pro` will be linked to the Vercel deployment.

## Non-Functional Requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- The portfolio website is accessible at `w1d.pro`.
- The GitHub repository `deadmantfa/portfolio-site` contains the full project source code.
